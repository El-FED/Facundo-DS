# Pharma Quality Prediction

Welcome to the "Pharma Quality Prediction" project folder! This repository contains all the resources related to my data science project focused on predicting pharmaceutical product quality during the manufacturing process.

## Project Overview

In this project, I leverage production data to proactively forecast the quality of pharmaceutical products as they progress through the manufacturing process. The primary objective is to prevent the allocation of resources to products that may ultimately fall short of meeting the stringent quality criteria, thereby optimizing resource allocation and production efficiency.

## Project Details

- **Technologies Used**:
  - Python
  - Libraries:
    - Pandas
    - Scikit-Learn
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn

- **Key Findings**:
  - [Summarize key findings and insights from the project.]

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- [**data/**](data/): Contains the dataset(s) used for analysis and documentation or reports
- [**notebooks/**](notebooks/): Includes Jupyter Notebook(s) or Python script(s) with the project's code and visualizations and plots generated during analysis.
